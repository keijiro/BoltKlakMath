KlakVS
======

**KlakVS** is an extension for visual scripting in Unity. It provides
miscellaneous math functions useful for creating procedural behaviors.

- **XXHash** (deterministic random number generator)
- **ExpTween**/**CdsTween** (generic interpolator)
- **Noise Source** (fractional Brownian motion)
- **On Keyboard Input** (keyboard input with the new Input System)

XXHash

**[XXHash]** is a lightweight non-cryptographic hash function with which you
can generate pseudo-random number sequences in a deterministic manner.

[XXHash]: https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash

The XXHash unit generates a random number based on the two inputs -- *Seed* and
*Data*. In our use case, *Data* simply works as a secondary random seed.

There are variants for different output types:

- **XXHashInt**
- **XXHashFloat**
- **XXHashVector3**
- **XXHashDirection** (uniformly distributed random points on a unit sphere)
- **XXHashRotation** (quaternion representing a random rotation)

ExpTween
--------

The **ExpTween** unit implements an exponential interpolation function that is
useful for creating ease-out animation.

A unique thing about ExpTween is that it doesn't require a control-flow
connection. It's a stateless function, so that it works only with value
connections.

There are variants for different types: **ExpTweenFloat**,
**ExpTweenVector3**, and **ExpTweenQuaternion**.

CdsTween
--------

The **CdsTween** unit implements a [critically damped spring smoothing function]
that is useful for creating smooth ease-in/out animation.

There are variants for different types: **CdsTweenFloat**,
**CdsTweenVector3**, and **CdsTweenQuaternion**.

NoiseSource
-----------

![NoiseSource](https://i.imgur.com/tp6i0hS.png)

The **NoiseSource** unit implements a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) using a
simplex noise function. It's useful to create natural wavy motion or
undulation/vibration.

There are variants for different output types: **NoiseSourceFloat**,
**NoiseSourceVector3**, **NoiseSourceQuaternion**.

OnKeyboardInput
---------------

The **OnKeyboardInput** unit is a simple replacement of the standard
OnKeyboardInput unit but with [the new Input System].

How to install the package
--------------------------

This package uses the [scoped registry] feature to resolve package
dependencies. Please add the following sections to the manifest file
(Packages/manifest.json).

[scoped registry]: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```
{
  "name": "Keijiro",
  "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
  "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
}
```

To the `dependencies` section:

```
"jp.keijiro.klak.visualscripting": "1.1.0"
```

After changes, the manifest file should look like below:

```
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "Keijiro",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "jp.keijiro.klak.visualscripting": "1.1.0",
    ...
```
